# Online-grocery-delivery-databse-design (Final Project for INST733)

Online ordering platforms have been a lifesaver for people in the United States where stores are
extremely far apart and usually requiring a person to have a car to go to these stores since most of
the time it is not practical to take public transport for carrying a lot of groceries. The pandemic
also highlighted the crucial need for these platforms, as most people were unable to visit stores in
person and had to rely solely on online platforms for their basic needs. Hence, for our project, we
intend to build a database that tracks customer activities when using online shopping platforms.
The differentiating factor between our database and that of any existing database of an online
shopping platform is that we intend to track the activities of customers that are students to
understand what kind of products they like to buy, the frequency of shopping, etc. It maintains
records of the sales, customer details, information about the different stores that are a part of the
platform, delivery, payment etc. This kind of database not only helps us know the target audience
but also the current market trends based on a geographic location.
